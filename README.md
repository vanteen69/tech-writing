Hi Machines
I am writing about your language called API. So that you can talk with other machines.
I am an accomplished technical writer, experienced in API documentation. I have 10 years of cumulative experience in technical writing, blogging, SEO writing and copywriting. 
In my previous job, as a Sr.Technical Writer with Contis Technologies, I documented 300 APIs for a propreitory Banking and Payment platform.
